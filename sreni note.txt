Python is an 'Interpreter'
LEFT to RIGHT
Interprets compiles each line of source code one by one. Adv. -  Easy to debug. 
Compiler compiles the entire code by combining it as a package. If there is an error, it will just say it is an error rather than explaining about the type or location of the error.

Difference between Interpreter and Compiler --> Interpreter codes are risky. In compiler, codes are safe as it cannot be cracked easily.

Low level language - Machine readable
High level language - User readable 

**Python is a high level language.
***Python is CASE-SENSITIVE

Any language for the matter should comprise of the following components:
1) Alpha numeric characters
2) Dictionary (Python modules) - LEXIS in Python
3) Syntax 
4) Symantics (should make sense/meaning)
