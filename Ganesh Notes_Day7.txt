Functions
---------
Functions are used when we want to execute a block of code repeatedly, without actually copy pasting the code again and again.

Functions are defined with syntax "def function name():"
**Function names are always used in lower case.

Functions can be called by the function name.

Example:
def sum_of_2_nos(x,y):
    return x + y

x = sum_of_2_nos(5,10)
print(x)

Output = 15

Difference between print and return -  Print overwrites the value upon program run and shows it as output.
Return saves the value of the inputs rather than just showing it as an output.

Class
-----
If multiplie functions are required to be re-used then they can be defined under a "Class"
Class is a group of functions.

Class name should be of Camel case (capitalize each word).
Class is a blueprint.
**Copy of a class is called "INSTANCE"

**Function inside a class is called "METHOD"

If a method starts and ends with "__name__ " with double underscore it calld a magic method/special method. Also called as 'Constructors'

-Magic method - __repr__

-Class level variables
-Assertion - is used for validation. Syntax - "assert condition, Processing/Message"

- Difference between constructors and destructors

- Decorators
