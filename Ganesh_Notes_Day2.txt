Data Types
----------

Integer - Whole numbers
Floating Point integer - Decimal numbers

Mathematical operation of 1 integer and 1 float will result in Float
Division of 1 integer by 1 integer will also result in Flot

BOOLEAN - True/False

Operators
---------
Basic Operators - 7
Comparison operators - 6

Basic Operators
---------------
Operators -> +, -, /, *, **, %, //
** - is at power of
% - Modulus - Gives reminder. In a%b, if a is lesser than b, it always returns 'a'
// - Floor division - Returns the answer as Integer (whole number) on Division

**Python follows BODMAS

Comparison Operators
--------------------
> , < , >=, <= , == , !=

Output of comparison operator calculation will be Boolean (True or False)

INPUT FUNCTION
==============
Argument of an input function is ALWAYS a String by default

Example: 
a= input ('Enter first no.')
b= input ('Enter second no.')

Output:
Enter first no. 3
Enter second no. 4
34

As data type of input is String

To overcome this we have to convert the data type of argument with in the 'input' function to the desired data type.

Example: 
a= input ('Enter first no.')
b= input ('Enter second no.')
print(int(a) + int(b))

Output:
Enter first no. 3
Enter second no. 4
7

Formatted String - Is invoked by adding 'f' before the quote of a print function argument.
Example:
name = 'Bob'
print (f"(Hello {name}!)
Output - Hello Bob!

Curly braces are used inside a fomatted string within which we can use any type of variable or even function.
Example: 
a=5
b=8
print(f"Sum of {a} and {b} is {a+b})

Output - Sum of 5 and 8 is 13

METHODS
