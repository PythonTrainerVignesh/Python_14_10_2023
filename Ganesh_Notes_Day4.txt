For Loop
--------
Follows the same syntax as if or while.
The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

Example: 
word = Mississippi
for i in word
  if i == 's'
    count += 1
print(count)

Output --> 4

**For loops are used when there can be an interation.
For example, word (in string) can be iterated as each character
number can be iterated as range.

COLLECTION OF OBJECTS - For the purpose of grouping
---------------------
If multiple values are assigned to a single variable inside paranthesis, then it is called a "tuple"
These are also known as "Immutable"
Example: nos = (1,2,3) 
If multiple values are assigned to a single variable inside square bracket, then it is called a "list"
These are known as "Mutable"
Example: nos = [1,2,3]

Difference between 'Mutable' and 'Immutable' - Immutables cannot be altered.

Multiple variables can be assigned in "dictionary". Curly braces are used  for dictionary.
Dictionary is mutable ie. can be altered.

'Key' and 'value' pairs
Example: nos_dict = {'uname' : 'Ganesh', 'passwrd' = 12345'}
*key comes at left and value comes at right
*key always should be a string, value can be of any data type
