Read a file using python
------------------------
r = read; a = append; w = write

Syntax --> with open('abcd.xls', 'r') as file:
File opened in Python always comes in as 'String'
File opened in Python should be assigned to a variable

Example:

import csv (csv is a pre-defined third party module available for python. This gives the method 'DictReader')
with open('data.csv','r') as file:
  x = csv.DictReader(file)
  for i in x:
    print(i)

This block of code imports the csv file - data.csv. Transforms the rows and columns as 'Dictionary' (Key value pairs)

To add rows in a Excel/csv: 
---------------------------
with open('data.csv','a',newline='') as file:
a = csv.DictWriter(file, ['name','price','quantity'])
a.writerow({'name':'mobile','quantity':'2'})
