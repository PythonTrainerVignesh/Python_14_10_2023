Python is an 'Interpreter'
LEFT to RIGHT
Interprets compiles each line of source code one by one. in interpret source code is open (not safe)  Adv. -  Easy to debug. 
Compiler compiles the entire code by combining it as a package. If there is an error, it will just say it is an error rather than explaining about the type or location of the error.
In compiler source code is safe

Difference between Interpreter and Compiler --> Interpreter codes are risky. In compiler, codes are safe as it cannot be cracked easily.

  # Python itself (from the installation)
  # Third-party modules (from Github, python repository etc) - Invoke third party modules using 'pip' command. connected from the internet.
