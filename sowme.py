Python is an 'Interpreter'
LEFT to RIGHT
Interprets compiles each line of source code one by one. in interpret source code is open (not safe)  Adv. -  Easy to debug. 
Compiler compiles the entire code by combining it as a package. If there is an error, it will just say it is an error rather than explaining about the type or location of the error.
In compiler source code is safe

Difference between Interpreter and Compiler --> Interpreter codes are risky. In compiler, codes are safe as it cannot be cracked easily.

Low level language - Machine readable
High level language - User readable 

Python is a high level language.
Python is CASE-SENSITIVE

LANGUAGE( 4 components)
  # alpha chars
  # dictionary(python modules) or also called "LEXIX"
  # syntax("eg:learning I python am")
  # symantics(sence/meaning)

MODULES:
Modules come from THREE different places
  # Python itself (from the installation)
  # Third-party modules (from Github, python repository etc) - Invoke third party modules using 'pip' command. connected from the internet.
  # From your own code

PEP: PYTHON ENHANCEMENT PROPOCALS
  --->style guide for python code.

#TO GO BACKWARDS FROM ONE FOLDER TO ANOTHER
---> cd..
#TO LIST FILES AND FOLDERS
--->dir
"git pull"---> the key word used to see the changes or updates what have they done.
#FOR CHANGING THE DRIVES
c: or d: or e: (enter)

Python extension .py

Code inside the text editor - Source code
File containing the source code - Source file 

To run a python program, in command prompt, type "python" followed by the absolute location of the source file.
  # Absolute path is the complete location of the file from the basic folder.
  # Relative path is the shorter file location path - which will be used in Linux

Comments can be differentiated from the source code by using # in front of each comment line.
Multi lines in a source code can be converted as comments by typing them between triple double quotes.

# PYTHON codes can be run in IDE's (Integrated Development Environment)
# PyCharm is one such IDE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DATA TYPES ( String,Integer,float,Boolean)

#STRING:-
  * anything which is under the double(") or single codes(')
example
  #print("hello")---->argument
  #print("897655578")
