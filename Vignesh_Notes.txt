# Language:

# 1. Alpha Chars
# 2. Dictionary (Python Modules) Lexis
# 3. Syntax (learning I python am)
# 4. Symantics (sense/meaning)

# Low-level Language - Machine readable
# High-level Language - User readable

# Interpreter - Source code is open.
# Easy to debug

# Compiler - Source code is safe.

# Modules come from 3 different places
# 1. Python itself
# 2. Third-party modules
# 3. From your own code

# Python is case sensitive
