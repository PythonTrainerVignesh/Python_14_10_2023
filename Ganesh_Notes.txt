Python is an 'Interpreter'
Interprets compiles each line of source code one by one. Adv. -  Easy to debug. 
Compiler compiles the entire code by combining it as a package. If there is an error, it will just say it is an error rather than explaining about the type or location of the error.

Difference between Interpreter and Compiler --> Interpreter codes are risky. In compiler, codes are safe as it cannot be cracked easily.

Low level language - Machine readable
High level language - User readable 

**Python is a high level language.
***Python is CASE-SENSITIVE

Any language for the matter should comprise of the following components:
1) Alpha numeric characters
2) Dictionary (Python modules) - LEXIS in Python
3) Syntax 
4) Symantics (should make sense/meaning)

Modules:
--------
Modules come from THREE different places
1) Python itself (from the installation)
2) Third-party modules (from Github, python repository etc) - Invoke third party modules using 'pip' command. connected from the internet.
3) From your own code


Python programs can be created with a text editor and saving the file with extension .py

Code inside the text editor - Source code
File containing the source code - Source file 

To run a python program, in command prompt, type "python" followed by the absolute location of the source file.
*Absolute location is the complete location of the file.

Comments can be differentiated from the source code by using # in front of each comment line.
Multi lines in a source code can be converted as comments by typing them between triple double quotes.

PYTHON Console
--------------
Example - IDLE (Integrated Development & Learning Environment) is where you can run python codes directly, without saving a python source file and running it separately.
*We can convert Command Prompt to a python console by just entering "python" and Enter
Console environment is denoted by '>>>' before each source code line.
To come out of Console -> enter 'exit ()'

GIT/GIT HUB
-----------
GIT HUB is nothing but a cloud storage solution for the source codes/fies.
GIT has to be installed separately in Windows to execute GIT commands.
Files saved in GIT HUB can be saved in local folders by using code "git clone" in command prompt/terminal.
This will create a live connection between local folder and GIT HUB location. "git pull" command can be used to refresh the files with latest changes.
